# The Tech Tree

Unlocking the tech tree requires a research station & scientist(s) to manage
it. The research station requires a number of materials to discover a new
technology, and the number of scientists will affect the speed the materials
are processed. Materials are hidden (blanked with ?????) until you have at
least one in your storage.
