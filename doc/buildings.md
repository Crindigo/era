# Buildings

Buildings are structures, farmland, or other types of placed object that
consumes a set amount of land. Some buildings are limited to 1, and others
have no limits. Buildings can have upgrades added to give extra features, make
them faster, or more efficient. Most buildings can be dismantled to free up 
land, you may or may not receive a (partial) refund on the material cost.
